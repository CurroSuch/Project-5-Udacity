# Project Instructions

1. First, you have to install the project on your computer just using "npm install" in your console.

2. Then you have to run webpack, using "npm run build-prod" in your console.

3. When you do that, you have to run the server before the app. You can do that with "npm run start".

4. The last step is to run the app. You can do it with the command "npm run build-dev".

5. And now you're using the Sentiment Analysis APP. Welcome!!
